        <h1>Rock Paper Scissors Rules</h1>
        <p>Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rock</strong> (a fist)</li>
            <li><strong>Paper</strong> (an open hand)</li>
            <li><strong>Scissors</strong> (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rock crushes Scissors</li>
            <li>Scissors cuts Paper</li>
            <li>Paper covers Rock</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The game is typically played in a best of three format, where the first player to win two rounds is declared the winner.</p>
